= Kb Shortcuts

Created by Joel Oliveira, May 2009.

This extension is a very simple implementation of a few keyboard shortcuts that allow quicker access to common
actions on the Radiant edit page.  Save (ctrl+shift+s), Save and Continue (ctrl+shift+c), view filters (ctrl+shift+f) 
and view available tags (ctrl+shift+t).

The large majority of javascript and hotkey support is provided by http://livepipe.net/extra/hotkey by 
the LivePipe team - http://github.com/syntacticx

== Installation

1) Unpack/checkout/export the extension into vendor/extensions of your project.

2) Run the extension update task to copy necessary JS files to the right location.

  $ rake production radiant:extensions:kb_shortcuts:update
  
3) Restart your server.
